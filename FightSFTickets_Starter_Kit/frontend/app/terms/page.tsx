                  FightCityTickets.com is a document preparation service. We
                  help you articulate and refine your own reasons for appealing
                  a parking ticket. We act as a scribe, helping you express what{" "}
                  <strong className="text-gray-900">you</strong> tell us is your
                  reason for appealing. We make the appeal process frictionless
                  so you are not intimidated into paying a ticket you believe is
                  unfair.

                  We are not a law firm, and we are not attorneys, legal
                  practitioners, or legal professionals. We do not provide legal
                  advice, legal representation, legal recommendations, or legal
                  guidance. We do not suggest legal strategies, interpret laws,
                  guarantee outcomes, or make representations about the success
                  of your appeal.

                  submission of your appeal. Using this Service does not create
                  an attorney-client relationship.
